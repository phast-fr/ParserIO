ParserIO README

What is ParserIO?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ParserIO is a barcode interpreter (parser). It takes one input string and it returns a well-structured output as result of the parsing.
ParserIO as ParserInterOpérable (Interoperable Parser) is a C# Class Library developed using Microsoft .NET 4.6.1.
 
You have 4 methods to integrate it within your software: 
1. You can integrate the C# namespace within your code
2. You can use the Class Library DLL reference
3. You can use the COM Interface

ParserIO is healthcare standards oriented.

It works very well with HIBC Barcode and we improve ceaselessly its performance with the GS1 Barcodes.
The EAN13 Barcodes are well parsed since the first release.
The non-standard barcodes are not parsed for the moment.
